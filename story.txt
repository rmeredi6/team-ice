In a town far far away, lived a little Bratwurst called Hans, trying to find his way.

To clear his mind, Hans hopped in his BMW and started driving aimlessly.

Driving aimlessly Hans crashed into a Porsche that was being driving by his high school girlfriend Matilda. 

Hans and Matilda decided to grab some food at the nearest Ratskeller, where they enjoyed a plate of Bratwurst and Apfelkuchen.

After finishing their Bratwurst, they were surprised to see a Hund happily munching on leftover Brot under the table.

Suddenly, it bit her Dirndl and ran towards a Rammstein concert that was down the block. So Hans and Matilda followed the music.

Hans and Matilda reminded of how they first met. He was working as a roadie for Rammstein when Matilda spotted the dapper Bratwurst wearing the finest Liderhose.

But out of no where, Hans ex college girlfriend Freya appears and reminds Han of her love for him. Matilda feeling betrayed throws her fresh Doener in his face and smears it down his shirt. 

Freya, determined to win Hans back, invited him to meet her at the majestic Schloss, where she promised to rekindle their old romance with the help of a delicious Gebaek she had baked herself.

Matilda yelled in anger that she was going to the Flughafen to catch the next flight to Berlin, leaving Hans and Freya to live happily never after.
